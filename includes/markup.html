<p class="charlie intro">Thankfully with the introduction of HTML5 we don't have to write anywhere near as much as we use to have to but that still doesn't mean this part is any less important.</p>

<h3>The Doctype</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</pre>
<p>Surely everyone is now working with this DOCTYPE and has been for a long time. This is supported by all browsers that mean anything (all it does is trigger standards mode) and is a million times shorter than any previous DOCTYPE.</p>

<div class="alert alert-friendly islet">
	<p class="flat">Remember to always import your Javascript files after your stylesheets to increase performance and stop any flashes of unstyled content (FOUC).</p>
</div>

<h3>The Viewport</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&gt;</pre>
<p>The viewport tag is a key ingredient to building responsive websites. It controls the way the website reacts to different device resolutions (mobiles, tablets etc). <code>width=device-width</code> tells the browser to assume that the page is as wide as the device. <code>initial-scale=1.0"</code> tells the browser not to zoom in or out and not make assumptions that the website is built for larger screens. You could set a <code>maximum-scale=1.0</code> if you would like to stop the user from zooming on the phone but there shouldn't be any reason you need to do this. If you want to more I suggest read the MDN page on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag/">META tags</a>.</p>
