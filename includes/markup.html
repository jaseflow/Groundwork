<p class="charlie intro">Thankfully with the introduction of HTML5 we don't have to write anywhere near as much as we use to have to but that still doesn't mean this part is any less important.</p>

<h3>The Doctype</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</pre>
<p>Surely everyone is now working with this DOCTYPE and has been for a long time. This is supported by all browsers that mean anything (all it does is trigger standards mode) and is a million times shorter than any previous DOCTYPE.</p>

<h3>The Charset</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</pre>
<p>This attribute declares the character encoding used for the page. UTF-8 is the encouraged character encoding. The META element must be within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and within the 512 first <strong>bytes</strong> of the page. That will surely come in use next pub night.</p>

<h3>The Viewport</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&gt;</pre>
<p>This is a topic of great discussion. This META tag is a key ingredient to building responsive websites, controlling the way the phone reacts to different device resolutions (mobiles, tablets etc). <code>width=device-width</code> tells the browser to assume that the page is as wide as the device. <code>initial-scale=1.0"</code> tells the browser not to zoom in or out and not make assumptions that the website is built for larger screens. You could set a <code>maximum-scale=1.0</code> if you would like to stop the user from zooming on the phone but there shouldn't be any reason you need to do this.</p>
