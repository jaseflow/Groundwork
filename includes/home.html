<p class="charlie intro">Groundwork is a collection of rock solid base styling and javascript architecture we can painlessly build large scale website.</p>

<h3>What is Groundwork?</h3>
<p>Building websites is easy, we have all done it a thousand times and the majority of the time things come together nicely. Then things start to turn pear shaped once we enter the maintenance phase. Bugs start popping up, we apply more and more code to cover up them up and before we know it we are up to our knees in messy code.</p>
<p>Groundwork simply provides you with a tried and tested front end architecture for building websites or web applications. Groundwork focuses on building a strong foundation that eases development right off the bat and allows the site to scale with ease.</p>
<h4>What isn't groundwork?</h4>
<p>Groundwork is not a collection of visual styles or awesome jQuery plugins. Your site will not look any prettier with Groundwork. It will not be a fully responsive, mobile ready fully featured website out of the box. Groundwork is here to be built on top of.</p>
<h3>Who is Groundwork for?</h3>
<p>Groundwork is targetted for intermediate designers &amp; developers who are working with or plan to be working with large scale websites.</p>
