<p class="charlie intro">Utility classes complete those little jobs that don't pop up around the website but just don't warrant there own stylesheet.</p>

<h3>The clear fix</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
.cf:before,
.cf:after {
  content:"";
  display:table;
}
.cf:after {
  clear:both;
}
// For IE 6/7 (trigger hasLayout)
.cf {
  *zoom:1;
}
</pre>
<p>There have been many clearing techniques in the past but this one just works and it lives up to its name, the <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/">Micro clearfix</a>. We use this to clear the container of floated elements. You will also notice that we chain any elements that frequently require a clear. This saves you from having to add <code>.cf</code> to every the same type of element every project. If you find your selector getting to long then you have look into refactoring your code and using more abstractions.</p>

<h3>Hide text</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
.hide-text {
  text-indent: 100%;
  white-space: nowrap;
  overflow: hidden;
}
</pre>
<p>This class should be used whenever you want to use a background image on any block element. This new technique makes a lot more sense than its predecessor which would text-indent some extreme fixed value that made sure it's off the page. Using such a large value meant the page actually had to render the dimensions which would cause performance issues (albeit minor). More on this can be seen on <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2012/03/01/replacing-the-9999px-hack-new-image-replacement/">Zeldman's blog</a></p>

<h3>Float classes</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
.left {
  float: left;
}
.right {
  float: right;
}
</pre>
<p>These float classes should be used sparingly. Remember we should be using a grid system to get the structure of the website together, floats and widths should never be applied to modules to allow them to be reused again in a different area of the site.</p>
